# Nikitas.io
This is a responsive portfolio site of Nikitas I/O.

- Center landing page content.
- If screen becomes larger, sidebar menu should close.

## responsiveness
I made sure that the website works beautifully for every device and screen size I've tried. 

## Logo
I intentionally used a Unicode character as a logo in order to minimize http requests, minimize my page's size, easily manipulate its natural size through CSS and scale the logo on any screen without having to worry about resolution.
