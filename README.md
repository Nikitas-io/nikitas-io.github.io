# Nikita's portfolio site

This is a responsive portfolio site made for Udacity's **Build a portfolio site** project. The theme I used for this project is calmness... A relaxed design.

## responsiveness

I made sure that the website works beautifully for every device and screen size I've tried. I also used Grunt in order to re-size and change the quality of images in order to fit each device's needs while keeping the page size small. After using Grunt I erased the images I did not want to use. If you know how I can choose to convert only certain images for certain sizes with the grunt responsive_images plugin please let me know, as I do not want to produce unnecessary images in sizes I do not want to use and then delete them.

## Logo

I intentionally used a Unicode character as a logo in order to minimize http requests, minimize my page's size, easily manipulate its natural size through CSS and scale the logo on any screen without having to worry about resolution.
